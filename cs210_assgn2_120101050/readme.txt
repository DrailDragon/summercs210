1. To compile type in terminal g++ avl_tree_using_array.cpp stack1.h stack1.cc.
2. To run ./a.out
3. This folder contains 9 files avl_tree_using_array.cpp, stack1.h, stack1.cpp, input_gen.txt, output_gen.txt, input.txt, output.txt, Assgn||.pdf ,readme.txt.
Assgn||.pdf contains problem-statement of this assignment.
4. avl_tree_using_array.cpp contains 
a. functions required for avltree creation and manipulation 
b. along with two main functions(One is commented).
c.Uncommented function which is encountered first while scroll down is to insert at bulk from file.Input file generated for this main function is input_gen.txt and corresponding output generated is in output_gen.txt.
Uncomment the commented part which is to generate input file input_gen.txt if you wish to generate new input file.If you generate new input file then change the string "OqGZmHlcEG"(currently) to some other which is present in that input file to test for other functions like find_kth_string_lexicographic,print path from string to root,get occurences of string,total number of strings etc.  
d. If you wish to use other main function uncomment it, comment previous and recompile the program. sample input-output files for this main function are input.txt and output.txt respectively.
 5. stack1.h contains prototypes(declarations) of functions used to manipulate stack of integers.
 6. stack.cc contains function definitios of stack declared in stack1.h. stack1.h and stack1.cc provide stack to get parent in avl-implementation.
 7. input_gen.txt contains space-separated alternate string and its occurence.orresponding output can be sent in output_gen.txt. One sample of input_gen.txt and output_gen.txt is given.
 8. For second main function input.txt and output.txt are sample input-output files.
